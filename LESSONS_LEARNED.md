## Error: Multi-line Git Commit Messages in Terminal
**Date**: 2024-12-19
**Context**: Trying to commit development rules with a detailed multi-line commit message
**Error**: Commit command hung with `dquote>` prompt, wouldn't complete
**Root Cause**: Terminal git commit with `-m` flag doesn't handle complex multi-line messages well with special characters
**Solution**: Use simple single-line commit messages, or use `git commit` without `-m` to open editor
**Prevention**: 
- Keep commit messages concise and single-line when using `-m` flag
- For detailed commits, use `git commit` to open editor instead
- Test commit message format before important commits
**Related**: [Git commit message best practices](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
