## Error: Multi-line Git Commit Messages in Terminal
**Date**: 2024-12-19
**Context**: Trying to commit development rules with a detailed multi-line commit message
**Error**: Commit command hung with `dquote>` prompt, wouldn't complete
**Root Cause**: Terminal git commit with `-m` flag doesn't handle complex multi-line messages well with special characters
**Solution**: Use simple single-line commit messages, or use `git commit` without `-m` to open editor
**Prevention**: 
- Keep commit messages concise and single-line when using `-m` flag
- For detailed commits, use `git commit` to open editor instead
- Test commit message format before important commits

## Error: API Authentication Headers Not Being Sent (401 Unauthorized)
**Date**: 2024-12-19
**Context**: User preferences PUT request failing with 401 "Access token required" error, while GET requests worked fine
**Error**: `PUT http://localhost:8000/api/preferences 401 (Unauthorized)` - Authorization header not being sent despite token being present in localStorage
**Root Cause**: In the API service's `request` method, the `...options` spread was placed after the headers object, potentially overriding the Authorization header when request options included headers
**Solution**: Moved the `...options` spread before the headers object in the request configuration:
```typescript
// BEFORE (problematic):
const config: RequestInit = {
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', ...authHeaders, ...options.headers },
  ...options,  // This could override headers
};

// AFTER (fixed):
const config: RequestInit = {
  ...options,  // Spread options first
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', ...authHeaders, ...options.headers },
};
```
**Prevention**: 
- Always be careful with object spread order when merging configurations
- Test authenticated API calls thoroughly, especially PUT/POST requests
- Use debugging logs to verify header contents during development
- Consider using a more explicit header merging approach for critical headers
**Related**: [MDN RequestInit documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit)

## ðŸ”„ Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: Review recent errors and update prevention strategies
- **Monthly**: Analyze patterns and update development rules
- **Per Phase**: Document major learnings at phase completion

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Reference - Common Solutions

### Development Environment
- Always check node version compatibility
- Clear npm cache if packages fail to install
- Restart development servers after major changes

### Git Best Practices
- Use single-line commit messages with `-m` flag
- Always test features before committing
- Push regularly to avoid losing work

### Debugging Strategies
- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Check terminal/server logs for backend errors
- Use step-by-step debugging rather than guessing
- Document the debugging process for future reference
