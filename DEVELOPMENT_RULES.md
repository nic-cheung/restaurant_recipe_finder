# Development Rules & Guidelines

## üé≠ Communication & Role-Playing Guidelines

### CEO-CTO Communication Protocol
- **Explain Like I'm Not Technical**: Always provide business-focused explanations for technical decisions
- **Sense-Check Everything**: Before implementing major features, explain the "why" and get approval
- **Progress Updates**: Regular status reports in business terms (features, timeline, risks)
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Explain trade-offs in terms of development time, user experience, and business value
- **Visual Aids**: Use diagrams, tables, and examples to illustrate technical concepts

### Technical Decision Framework
When making technical choices, always explain:
1. **What** we're building
2. **Why** this approach (business benefits)
3. **How long** it will take
4. **What could go wrong** (risks)
5. **Alternative options** and their trade-offs

### Documentation Style
- Use business language first, technical details second
- Include "Executive Summary" sections for complex topics
- Provide analogies and real-world examples
- Focus on user experience and business outcomes

## üéØ Project Rules

### 1. Project Tracking & Progress Management
- **PROJECT_PLAN.md Updates**: ALWAYS update PROJECT_PLAN.md when completing features
- **Real-Time Progress**: Mark items as complete `[x]` immediately after implementation
- **Phase Tracking**: Update phase completion percentages as we progress
- **Status Reviews**: Check project plan before starting new work to ensure alignment
- **Completion Criteria**: Define clear completion criteria for each feature
- **Documentation Updates**: Update "What's Been Built" section with new accomplishments

#### Project Tracking Workflow:
1. **Before Starting**: Check PROJECT_PLAN.md to understand current phase and priorities
2. **During Development**: Use TODO lists to track immediate tasks
3. **After Completion**: 
   - Mark items complete `[x]` in PROJECT_PLAN.md
   - Update phase completion percentages
   - Add accomplishments to "What's Been Built" section
   - Update "Next Steps" if priorities change
   - **COMMIT IMMEDIATELY**: Always commit and push changes after completing a feature
4. **Regular Reviews**: Assess overall project health and adjust timeline as needed

#### Progress Reporting Format:
- **Phase Status**: "Phase X: Y% Complete - [Brief Description]"
- **Recent Accomplishments**: List of completed features with business value
- **Current Focus**: What we're working on now
- **Next Priorities**: What comes next according to the plan
- **Blockers/Risks**: Any issues that could impact timeline

#### Milestone Management:
- **Phase Completion**: Celebrate when completing each phase (update README, commit progress)
- **Feature Demos**: Test major features immediately after implementation
- **Progress Commits**: Commit PROJECT_PLAN.md updates with meaningful commit messages
- **Momentum Tracking**: Keep track of development velocity and adjust expectations
- **Success Metrics**: Measure progress against original timeline and scope

#### Project Health Indicators:
- ‚úÖ **Green**: On track, features working as expected, no major blockers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow**: Minor delays or issues, but manageable with current resources
- üî¥ **Red**: Major blockers, significant delays, or scope changes needed

#### Commit & Version Control Rules:
- **Feature Completion Commits**: ALWAYS commit immediately after completing any feature
- **Commit Message Format**: Use descriptive commit messages that explain the business value
- **Commit Frequency**: Commit working code frequently, don't wait for perfect completion
- **Push Regularly**: Push to remote repository at least once per session
- **Documentation Updates**: Include PROJECT_PLAN.md updates in the same commit as the feature

#### Commit Message Template:
```
feat: [Feature Name] - [Business Value]

‚úÖ COMPLETED: [What was built]

Implementation Details:
- [Technical detail 1]
- [Technical detail 2]
- [Technical detail 3]

Project Status:
- [Phase X]: [Y%] Complete
- [Next priority or blocker]

[Optional: Screenshots, performance notes, or testing results]
```

#### When to Commit:
- ‚úÖ **After completing a full feature** (e.g., user preferences page)
- ‚úÖ **After fixing a significant bug**
- ‚úÖ **After adding new API endpoints**
- ‚úÖ **After updating documentation or project plans**
- ‚úÖ **Before switching to a different feature**
- ‚úÖ **At the end of each development session**

### 2. Code Organization
